This is a seemingly impossible project. We are to convert
an array into an AVL tree, but we are not allowed to rotate,
and are limited to 3 functions, each of which may only have
40 lines due to Betty format restrictions. I know this task
is possible, but it currently escapes my grasp. Hopefully
I will prove myself wrong.
